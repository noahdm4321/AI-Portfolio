# Othello

## Goal:
##### The goal of the game is to have the majority of your disks showing your color on the board at the end of the game.

## Rules:
1. The game is played on a 8x8 grid. The game starts with four disks placed in the center of the board: two black and two white, arranged diagonally.
2. Each player uses disks of their color: the player is black ⚫ and the computer is white ⚪.
3. Players take turns placing one disk of their color on an empty square of the board. By clicking in the square that you wish to place your disk. 
4. When a player places a disk, they must capture at least one of their opponent's disks. Capturing is done by surrounding a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of opponent's disks with two of their own. The captured disks are then changed to the current player's color.
5. A player must make a move if there is a legal move available. If a player cannot make a legal move, they must pass their turn to the opponent.
6. The game continues until the entire board is filled or no legal moves are left for both players.
7. When the game ends, the player with the most disks of their color on the board wins.

##### This program involves transition models, knowledge-based agents, and deep learning/neural network method (keras). 

###### The program for the Othello game is adapted from <https://github.com/SiyanH/othello-game> which uses random selection to determine the computer's move. The deep learning alorithm was programmed by me.

## Goal:
##### The goal of the game is to have the majority of your discs showing your color on the board at the end of the game.

## Rules:
1. The game is played on a 8x8 grid. The game starts with four discs placed in the center of the board: two black and two white, arranged diagonally.
2. Each player uses discs of their color: the player is white ⚪ and the computer is black ⚫.
3. Players take turns placing one disc of their color on an empty square of the board. By entering the letter column and number row desired. 
4. When a player places a disc, they must capture at least one of their opponent's discs. Capturing is done by surrounding a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of opponent's discs with two of their own. The captured discs are then changed to the current player's color.
5. A player must make a move if there is a legal move available. If a player cannot make a legal move, they must pass their turn to the opponent.
6. The game continues until the entire board is filled or no legal moves are left for both players.
7. When the game ends, the player with the most discs of their color on the board wins.

# AI Portfolio
#### Each folder contains a different game with a Python script programmed to play the game against you. As the games increase in complexity, the program also increases in complexity to demonstrate my AI programming ability.

## AI Skills Showcased
1. [Rock Paper Scissors](01_Rock-Paper-Scissors)
  - First, we start with the most basic strategy: random selection.
2. [Tic Tac Toe](02_Tic-Tac-Toe)
  - The program now increases in complexity by using a rule-based search algorithm to determine the best move.
3. [Operation Relay](03_Operation-Relay)
  - This is an original game designed by myself in order to prove that I am the one programing these AIs. 
  - The program now becomes a traditional AI, by using a q-learning algorithm combined with guided reinforcement learning to improve the AI's strategy.
4. [Othello](04_Othello)
  - We have now reached the extent of my AI knowledge. I used the keras python library in combination with a Monte Carlo Tree search algorithm to train a deep learning neural network how to play Othello. Probably not the most efficient way to play Othello, but I couldn't just do q-learning again. 

## Using the scripts
#### If you want to use any of these scripts for your own purposes, feel free. The purpose of this repository is to showcase my programming skills. Thus, all of the code is written 100% from scratch, except of the Othello game (see [Othello README.md](04_Othello/README.md) for more details).

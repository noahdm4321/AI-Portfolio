# Operation Relay

## Goal:
##### The goal of the game is to be the first person to reach the target number.

## Rules:
1. Start with the number 1.
2. The players take turns performing addition or multiplication on the previous number to reach the next number in the sequence.
3. Players can add `+` by any number from 1-5 or players can multiply `*` by any number from 2-5. 
4. If a player's move would result in a number greater than the target number, they must choose a different operation or a different number to use in their move.
5. The game continues until one player reaches the target number. The first player to reach the target number wins the game.

# Operation Relay

## Goal:
##### The goal of the game is to be the first person to reach the number 20.

## Rules:
1. Start with the number 1.
2. The players take turns performing one of the four operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) on the previous number to reach the next number in the sequence.
3. Players can add `+` or subtract `-` by any number from 1-5 or players can multiply `*` or divide `/` by any number from 2-5. 
  - Example: If the current number is 12 and you enter `/3`, the result would be 4.
4. If a player's move would result in a number greater than 20, they must choose a different operation or a different number to use in their move.
5. If a player's move would not result in a whole number, they must choose a different operation or a different number to use in their move.
6. The game continues until one player reaches the number 20. The first player to reach 20 wins the game.
